## üí° Future Improvements & Contribution Ideas

If you'd like to contribute to this project, here are some feature suggestions that could be part of the next version:

1. **Add Emojis for Team Scores**: 
   - For example, display a celebratory emoji when **Team A** or **Team B** scores a point.
   - You can use different emojis based on the type of score (1, 2, or 3 points).

2. **Implement a Match Timer**:
   - Add a countdown timer to simulate a real match scenario.
   - The timer could be configurable (e.g., 5 minutes, 10 minutes, etc.).

3. **Declare the Winner When Time Runs Out**:
   - Once the timer reaches zero, display a pop-up box announcing the winner (e.g., "Team A Wins!" or "It's a Draw!").
   - Optionally, reset the scores and timer for a new game.

4. **Enhance the UI with Animations**:
   - Consider adding animations for button presses or score changes.
   - For example, animate the score increment with a bounce effect.

5. **Add Sound Effects**:
   - Play a sound when a team scores or when the match ends.
   - Use different sound effects for different actions (like a whistle when the timer ends).

6. **Dark Mode Support**:
   - Provide an option to switch between light and dark themes.
   - This would enhance user experience, especially for those using the app in low-light conditions.
